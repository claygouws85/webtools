      <h3><strong>Early Life </strong></h3>
      <p>Benjamin John Howard was born on 24 April 1987 in Richmond, south-west London, England,<sup>[5]</sup> and moved
        near
        Totnes, Devon<sup>[5]</sup> when he was about eight. He was raised by musical parents who exposed him to their
        favourite records
        from singer-songwriter artists from the 1960s and 1970s at an early age, such as John Martyn, Van Morrison, Joni
        Mitchell andMitchell and
        Simon & Garfunkel, by whom he was strongly influenced.
      </p>
      <p>Howard began writing songs when he was eleven.<sup>[5]</sup> In an interview with American Songwriter, he
        stated that when
        he was a kid he started playing guitar because he liked to put words together and make stuff up. <em><q>I was
            quite an
            imaginative little kid I guess. So your standard little love songs turned into your standard adolescent love
            songs. I think
            you start getting your own take on things when you're a late teen. That's when everything
            changes.</q></em><sup>[7]</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Besides
        playing the guitar, Howard also played other instruments as a kid. He easily picked up the drums and contrabass,
        but after
        some time he decided to focus on the guitar. After attending King Edward VI Community College and Torquay Boys'
        Grammar
        School he began studying Journalism at University College Falmouth. Six months prior to completion of his
        course, Howard
        decided to focus on making music full-time, making melodic rootsy folk music, with progressively darker lyrics.
        His
        reputation grew around Devon, and soon spread to other areas of the UK. After a month of sold-out dates across
        Europe and
        the UK Howard was eventually asked to sign for Island Records.
        Due to his association with the town, Howard was chosen in 2014 to appear on the 10 Totnes pound
        note.<sup>[8]</sup>

      <h3>Music Career</h3>
      <h4>2008-2011: Early Releases</h4>
      <p>
        
        Before signing to a record label, Howard had already released some material. In 2008 he self-released his debut
        EP Games in the Dark. His first major release was These Waters, an EP featuring six tracks, including "The
        Wolves". In
        2010, Ben Howard released the Old Pine EP, followed by a number of singles, such as "The Fear" and "Keep Your
        Head Up".
        Howard now had enough material to release an album, Every Kingdom, which would feature a number of his previous
        singles.
        One of the songs from this album, 'Promise' was used in the first episode of The 100.[9]
      </p>
      <p>In 2010, he also started
        supporting Angus & Julia Stone's concerts in Europe. He also joined them for one live performance of Yellow
        Brick Road in Paris.
      </p>
      <h4>2011â€“13: Every Kingdom</h4>
      <p>Howard signed to Island Records in 2011, due to the label's history of UK folk singers, including Nick Drake
        and John
        Martyn.[11] After singles "Old Pine" and "The Wolves" were released in 2011, Howard recorded his debut album
        entitled
        Every Kingdom, which was released on 3 October 2011. He was nominated for the 2012 Mercury Prize.
      </p>

      <p>Howard worked alongside India Bourne, Marcus Wright and Chris Bond to make Every Kingdom, with Bourne playing
        cello,
        keyboards, ukulele, bass and contributing vocals and percussion, Bond playing guitars, bass, double bass, drums,
        percussion, keyboards, accordion, contributing to vocals, and also producing the record, and additional
        modular-dynamic
        (MD) synthesisers provided by Wright. He also toured with Bourne and Bond on his 2012 Every Kingdom tour, with
        support
        from Willy Mason.
      </p>

      <p>In 2012, Howard launched his music in America with Every Kingdom being released on 3 April 2012, and
        appearances
        at
        South by Southwest (SXSW) in Texas and a US tour confirmed.[12] His song "Promise" was featured at the end of
        season 8,
        episode 12 of TV show House.

        In May 2012, Howard performed "The Wolves" on Later... with Jools Holland. He played at Pinkpop in the
        Netherlands on 26
        May and Radio 1's Big Weekend in Hackney on 24 June 2012. He also played at the 2012 Bonnaroo Music Festival in
        Manchester, Tennessee,[13] the 2012 T in the Park music festival in Scotland, as well as Beach Break Live 2012
        in South
        Wales, Bestival 2012 and Splendour in the Grass 2012. Howard also played a slot at the Austin City Limits Music
        Festival
        in October 2012.[14]

        In November 2012, Howard released The Burgh Island EP produced by Chris Bond, which featured four new tracks.
        Once again
        released to critical acclaim, the EP had a darker, more menacing tone than most of Howard's previous work, with
        Howard
        also playing electric guitar, rather than his traditional acoustic. The second track from the EP, "Oats in the
        Water",
        was featured in Internment, the 5th episode in Season 4 of AMC's The Walking Dead, in the 1st episode in season
        3 of
        Fox's The Following, and in the release trailer for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. In 2014, the song "Promise" from
        the album
        Every Kingdom featured in the USA Network drama, Suits Season 3 Episode 11, "Buried Secrets" along with The CW
        drama
        Reign Season 1 Episode 10, "Sacrifice".
      </p>

      <p>In 2013, Ben Howard began collaborating with the musician and filmmaker Mickey Smith, who would become a
        mainstay
        co-writer and performer on all of Howard's subsequent albums.[15][16]Smith joined Howard's band for their
        performance on
        the main Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury Festival 2013, on Saturday 29 June 2013, which saw them play six tracks
        from Every
        Kingdom.</p>

      <h3>Personal Life</h3>
      <p>Howard has been in a relationship with fashion designer Agatha Lintott since 2014.[24] He is an avid surfer
        [25][26] and
        a supporter of Liverpool F.C.[27][28]

        In 2022, Howard suffered two transient ischaemic attacks, which affected his memory and speech. The experience
        influenced his 2023 album Is It? and led him to quit smoking.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Guitar Style</h3>
      <p>Howard plays guitar left-handed. On most of his songs, he plays a restrung guitar, but on some he plays a
        right-handed
        guitar upside down (What the Moon Does). He makes extensive use of alternate tunings such as CGCGGC (Old Pine,
        Everything, The Wolves), DADGAD (In Dreams, There's Your Man) and CGA#GFC (End of the Affair, Esmerelda). He
        also
        complements these tunings by using a partial capo for many songs (Further Away, Everything, End of the Affair,
        Boat to
        an Island on the Wall) in order to use harmonic or bass notes otherwise unavailable.
      </p>

      <p>He also has a distinctive percussive strumming style, called the "pick and go",[30] and Howard's method of
        laying the
        guitar flat on top of his knees and playing it percussively was influenced by contemporary folk songwriter and
        guitarist
        John Smith.</p>
