        <a name="faq4">What has his music career been like?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Howard began writing songs when he was eleven. In an interview with American Songwriter, he stated that when he was a
      kid he started playing guitar because he liked to put words together and make stuff up. "I was quite an imaginative
      little kid I guess. So your standard little love songs turned into your standard adolescent love songs. I think you
      start getting your own take on things when you're a late teen. That's when everything changes." 
      </p>
      <p>Besides playing the guitar, Howard also played other instruments as a kid. He easily picked up the drums and contrabass, but after some time
      he decided to focus on the guitar. After attending King Edward VI Community College and Torquay Boys' Grammar School he
      began studying Journalism at University College Falmouth, Cornwall. Six months prior to completion of his course, Howard
      decided to focus on making music full-time, making melodic rootsy folk music, with progressively darker lyrics. His
      reputation grew around Cornwall and Devon, and soon spread to other areas of the UK. After a month of sold-out dates
      across Europe and the UK Howard was eventually asked to sign for Island Records.
